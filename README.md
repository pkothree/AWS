# AWS
Amazon Web Services Scripts
I will post a couple of AWS scripts in the near future and provide a short explanation here.


#GetInstancesRunning.ps1
This script will simply run through all the region in AWS and will check if any instance has the state "running". You can check for every possible state there is.
